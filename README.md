# UTD (Currently in the making)
UTD (or Universal Tool for Dependencies) is a tool that manages project dependencies for you! When building a project, managing dependencies can get quite confusing, however this tool makes life just that much easier! 

This tool is currently being built, and currently natively supports Windows and Mac using .NET MAUI. Please feel free to add some more UI and features or make this app be able to run on linux machines.

Here are the steps for installation (with maybe some errors).

## 1. Prerequisites (also maybe some errors or incomplete)
- Visual Studio 2022 with the following components
    - .NET Desktop Development
- Windows App SDK
- Windows SDK

## 2. Building from source code
You can clone the repository using 
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Peggun/UTD
```

Open the solution and then select UTD.UI for the startup project.

## 3. Run
After this you can run the code, and have fun developing UTD!
