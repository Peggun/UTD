# UTD (Currently in the making)
UTD (or Universal Tool for Dependencies) is a tool that manages project dependencies for you! When making a project, managing dependencies can get quite confusing, however this tool makes life just that much easier! 

This tool is currently being built, and only supports Windows using WinUI 3 and C# projects. Anyone who would like to help, whether building the GUI of our app, adding support for a different language, or porting our app to different OS' like Mac is welcome. 

Here are the steps for installation (with maybe some errors).

## 1. Prerequisites (also maybe some errors or incomplete)
- Visual Studio 2022 with the following components
    - .NET Desktop Development
- Windows App SDK
- Windows SDK

## 2. Building from source code
You can clone the repository using 
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Peggun/UTD
```

After this, open the solution and make sure (for now) UTD.WindowsGUI is selected.

## 3. Run
After this you can run the code, and have fun developing UTD!
